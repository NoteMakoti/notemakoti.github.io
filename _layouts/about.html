            <h3>Part gym rat, part geek; I enjoy making websites that not only look good, but feel good to use.</h3>
            <h4>The way I see it, there are too many websites nowadays that either look like great magazine spreads (while running slowly with janky scrolling), perform very well (while looking like a 4th grader’s first PowerPoint presentation), or just don’t look special at all (due to an overreliance on pre-made templates and website “generators” like Squarespace). A web developer’s job is to help promote a client’s message, and to make the user’s experience seamless and captivating. It requires empathy, and you won’t find that with something who automates the whole process for a quick buck.</h4>

            <h2>Want to know what my workstation is like?</h2>
            <h4>Sometimes it’s a mechanical keyboard and a big beefy desktop with three monitors, dual-booting Windows and Debian, with Sublime Text 3 taking up half a screen, and folders, Photoshop, terminals, and test browsers taking up everything else. Sometimes it’s the laptop I’ve borrowed from the host of a party I was invited too, hurriedly pushing a content change a client requested over e-mail 5 minutes ago. Sometimes, rarely, it’s having Coda open on my iPhone and ignoring it to watch Netflix. Whatever serves.</h4>
